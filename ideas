AParsec: an Applicative/Alternative Parser Combinator Library
=============================================================

Don't duplicative combinators provided by Control.Applicative

Provide all combinators as generic to Applicative or Alternative when possible

Use the magic of applicatives to do cool stuff

  It seems like it should be possible for the internals to actually build up an
  AST-ish representation of the grammar, so that the applicative combinators become
  a DSL not for making a parser, but for making a grammar

    And this would let us potentially output syntax diagrams using the parser as
    the input!

  Prove that this can be done.
