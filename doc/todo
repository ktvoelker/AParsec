Implement the BNF generator

  We need to bring in the idea from Control.Applicative.Depth: the PInfo node is
  very important, and should probably be called something like PLabel. It is what
  makes all of this cool stuff possible - you put a PLabel at the top of any
  non-terminal, but definitely at the top of any recursive non-terminal, in order to
  provide the library with a way of finding the recursion.

  Also, BNF needs names for things to make sense! So actually, the whole
  parserToBNF project should require that the top-level node be PLabel (or some other
  innocuous thing that contains a PLabel near the top).

Come up with a good syntactic way to attach PLabel nodes
