TO DO
=====

Write tests

  Finish instance Arbitrary PrefixParser

    Make a separate instance (with a newtype) for generating recursive parsers

  Write some properties

    A lot of these might have the form "given some arbitrary parsers Pi, combine them
    with these different combinators in different ways to get some expected result
    relative to each other"

Improve error messages

Use non-terminal labels to simplify error messages

Use non-terminal labels to catch left recursion

Can we have a Monad instance after all?
