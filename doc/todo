TO DO
=====

Write a function that tests for cases where PRepeat is applied to a parser that
can accept the empty string

Upgrade acceptEmpty to handle recursive parsers

Write tests

  Write some properties
    A lot of these might have the form "given some arbitrary parsers Pi, combine them
    with these different combinators in different ways to get some expected result
    relative to each other"

  Use ReaderT to generate recursive parsers
    There should be two different alternatives that generate PLabel
      One generates a new label
      The other returns a PLabel from the environment
        This will involve some knot-tying

Improve error messages

Use non-terminal labels to simplify error messages

Use non-terminal labels to catch left recursion

Can we have a Monad instance after all?
