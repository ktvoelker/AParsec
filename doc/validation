Grammar Validation
==================

Check that Fail only occurs at the beginning of an alternative

  This could actually be encoded into the data structure...

Check that Repeat is not applied to a parser that can accept Empty

Check that nothing is accepted after End

  Including another End

Check for overlap between alternatives

  The simplest form is to look for a later alternative that can never be accepted
  because its language is a subset of an earlier alternative

  One more subtle check is to see if there is a Repeat which is limited by previous
  alternatives to accepting a finite number of repetitions (most likely zero)

  Another subtle check is to see if there is some internal sub-alternative which can
  never be accepted

Check for directly-nested Repeats, or other cases where everything inside a Repeat
could be Empty other than another Repeat

Warn about directly-nested Try, because it's pointless and might indicate a problem

Check for left-recursion, as indicated by the non-terminal labels

Warn about recursive uses of Try
